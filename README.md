  ## Description
  This app will dynamically generate a professional readme for you based on your inputs. With inquirer and fs installed, open the integrated terminal and run "node index.js". This will trigger a series of questions for you to fill out and will generate a professional README.md file with the inputs you provide. This readme will be generated in the "Output" folder.
